# Abstract

Using trade-level data from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, we document an asymmetric pattern of liquidity provision by individual investors who serve as *de facto* market makers. Specifically, on average, individual investors provide more liquidity during market declines. We further investigate the impact of asymmetric individual liquidity provision on [market efficiency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/efficient-market-hypothesis "Learn more about market efficiency from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Despite being uninformed, individual investorsâ€™ liquidity provision ameliorates market efficiency more during market declines. Our results suggest that individual investors provide liquidity to help those with private information correct prices toward efficient prices, in turn, enhancing market efficiency.
