Welcome to my website!

I am a Finance PhD at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I am primarily intrigued in corporate finance, corporate governance, and behavioral finance. Sub-fields include innovation, ESG, institutional investors, and mutual funds.

Here is our new building for Nanyang Business School, GAIA, just launching in use since June 2023.
