    "text": "Abstract\nThis study investigates whether mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting ameliorates liquidity and reduces risk for stocks. Moreover, we explore whether these impacts vary with regulated company category and stakeholder influence capacity. For a mandatory CSR reporting regulation in Taiwan, we assess the policy’s effects using difference-in-differences (DID) modeling. The results show that mandatory CSR reporting significantly increases liquidity and reduces idiosyncratic risks. However, the effect on systematic risk is asymmetric—a high (low) systematic risk is accompanied by a positive (negative) market return; namely, a large (small) price increase (decrease) caused by a positive (negative) market return. This aligns with the insurance-like benefits argument. These findings suggest investors hold on to CSR firms because of increased information transparency and good financial performance during a recession. The improved liquidity is more significant for firms in the electronics and chemical industries and for firms with a large equity share owned by domestic institutional investors. Idiosyncratic risk is reduced more for the latter two. The findings provide feedback on mandatory CSR reporting to policy makers and provide reference for firms and investors."

Specifically, on average, individual investors provide more liquidity during market declines. We further investigate the impact of asymmetric individual liquidity provision on market efficiency. Despite being uninformed, individual investors’ liquidity provision ameliorates market efficiency more during market declines. Our results suggest that individual investors provide liquidity to help those with private information correct prices toward efficient prices, in turn, enhancing market efficiency."

Using the California Senate Bill No. 826 and peer female director appointments as quasi-experimental settings, our findings demonstrate that firms under common ownership exhibit greater female board representation and a higher propensity to appoint new female directors. Furthermore, these firms show an increased likelihood of women attaining leadership positions on board committees. Our results remain robust to accounting for the activeness of the Big Three, underscore the network effect of common ownership on the supply side of the labor market for female directors."

    "title": "Socially Responsible Investing: A Financial Trend with a Conscience",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In today’s global economy, investors are increasingly concerned not only with financial returns but also with the ethical implications of their investments. Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) has emerged as a prominent strategy that combines financial considerations with social and environmental values. This approach empowers investors to align their portfolios with their beliefs and has reshaped the investment landscape.\n\nWhat is Socially Responsible Investing (SRI)?\nSRI considers both financial returns and social/environmental impacts. It involves evaluating investments based on ethical, social, and environmental criteria, often referred to as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. By excluding or favoring certain sectors or companies, SRI seeks to promote responsible business practices and contribute to sustainable development. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, emphasizes this dual focus: “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients.”\n\n\nThe Historical Context\nThe roots of SRI can be traced back to the religious movements of the 18th century, where certain investments were avoided on moral grounds. The modern SRI movement gained traction during the 1960s, focusing on issues like apartheid, labor rights, and environmental protection. Today, SRI has evolved into a comprehensive investment philosophy that incorporates various ethical considerations.\n\n\nMethods of SRI\n\nScreening: Investors may exclude or include companies based on specific ESG criteria. Negative screening avoids sectors such as tobacco and weapons, while positive screening favors companies with strong social and environmental performance.\nShareholder Advocacy: Through engagement and proxy voting, investors can influence corporate behavior and promote responsible governance.\nImpact Investing: Targeting investments that generate both financial returns and positive social or environmental impacts, impact investing seeks to create tangible societal benefits.\nCommunity Investing: By investing in community development projects, investors can support underserved areas and foster local economic growth.\n\n\n\nRelevance to Corporate Finance and Governance\nSRI has significant implications for corporate finance and governance. It highlights the interconnectedness of financial performance and societal well-being, challenging traditional investment models. Corporations are encouraged to improve their ESG performance to attract SRI capital, driving a broader shift towards transparency, accountability, and long-term sustainability.\n\n\nConclusion\nSocially Responsible Investing represents a transformative approach that aligns financial objectives with ethical values. By integrating social and environmental considerations into investment decisions, SRI offers a holistic perspective that resonates with a growing number of investors. It reflects a profound shift in the investment world, one that acknowledges that profitability and responsibility need not be mutually exclusive.\nWhether you are an individual investor or a financial institution, understanding and implementing SRI can offer a meaningful way to align your investment strategy with your values. As this field continues to evolve, it promises to play a critical role in shaping a more sustainable and conscientious financial future."

The baseline results indicate a positive correlation between the supply of female directors in peer firms and the representation of women in the focal firm, as well as an increased likelihood of new female director appointments. In addition, these firms show an increased likelihood of women attaining leadership positions on board committees. Using the California Senate Bill No. 826 and peer female director appointments as quasi-experimental settings, the difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) analysis shows that firms under common ownership narrow the gap between the current and mandated numbers of female directors. The results remain robust in accounting for the activeness of the Big Three and underscore the network effect of common ownership on the supply side of the labor market for female directors."

You can choose any time horizon that suits your analysis. This is based on the implicit assumption that the estimated beta using historical data represents the stock’s riskiness in recent periods.↩︎\nYou might be wondering why the risk-free rate is ignored in the market model. Indeed, some people would regress \\(R_i-R_f\\) on \\(R_M-R_f\\), where the risk-free rate, \\(R_f\\), is typically measured by Treasury Bill yields. Including the risk-free rate will make beta coefficient slightly different, but the change will be usually minor. For simplicity, you may choose to ignore the risk-free rate.↩︎"

The impact of environmental performance on financial performance and stock returns is not only related to the government regulations and public attention to environmental issues in the company’s industry, but also to the degree to which the industry is integrated into global supply chains. For the manufacturing industry, corporate environmental performance has a significant positive impact on both financial performance and stock returns of the company."

Employing a news-based dataset, we observe a substantial increase in PD relating to innovation progress post-SEO, in contrast to disclosures concerning new product introductions. Moreover, we find a negative association between post-issue operating performance and progress-type PD. These findings imply a tendency in equity markets to underestimate the failure risks associated with product innovation. The robustness of our results is maintained even after controlling for endogeneity concerns."
