    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis study investigates whether mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting ameliorates liquidity and reduces risk for stocks. Moreover, we explore whether these impacts vary with regulated company category and stakeholder influence capacity. For a mandatory CSR reporting regulation in Taiwan, we assess the policy’s effects using difference-in-differences (DID) modeling. The results show that mandatory CSR reporting significantly increases liquidity and reduces idiosyncratic risks. However, the effect on systematic risk is asymmetric—a high (low) systematic risk is accompanied by a positive (negative) market return; namely, a large (small) price increase (decrease) caused by a positive (negative) market return. This aligns with the insurance-like benefits argument. These findings suggest investors hold on to CSR firms because of increased information transparency and good financial performance during a recession. The improved liquidity is more significant for firms in the electronics and chemical industries and for firms with a large equity share owned by domestic institutional investors. Idiosyncratic risk is reduced more for the latter two. The findings provide feedback on mandatory CSR reporting to policy makers and provide reference for firms and investors."

    "text": "Highlights\n\nIndividual investors tend to be uninformed de facto market makers.\nIndividual investors provide more liquidity during market declines.\nIndividual liquidity provision can help in improving market efficiency when sufficient.\nInformed liquidity demanders are present.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nUsing trade-level data from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, we document an asymmetric pattern of liquidity provision by individual investors who serve as de facto market makers. Specifically, on average, individual investors provide more liquidity during market declines. We further investigate the impact of asymmetric individual liquidity provision on market efficiency. Despite being uninformed, individual investors’ liquidity provision ameliorates market efficiency more during market declines. Our results suggest that individual investors provide liquidity to help those with private information correct prices toward efficient prices, in turn, enhancing market efficiency."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis study investigates the potential of common ownership to expand the pool of female director candidates and alleviate the underrepresentation of women on corporate boards. Using the California Senate Bill No. 826 and peer female director appointments as quasi-experimental settings, our findings demonstrate that firms under common ownership exhibit greater female board representation and a higher propensity to appoint new female directors. Furthermore, these firms show an increased likelihood of women attaining leadership positions on board committees. Our results remain robust to accounting for the activeness of the Big Three, underscore the network effect of common ownership on the supply side of the labor market for female directors."
